This site contains a collection of tutorials for web developers using argon.js to add AR content to a web application. On this page, we provide an overview of the design of argon.js, introducing the terminology and concepts used by the framework. In the tutorials, we will go through a sequence of examples that show how to leverage the various features of argon.js in a web application.

The initial release of argon.js works primarily in the [Argon4](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/Argon4/id944297993?ls=1&mt=8) browser for iOS, and these tutorials focus specifically on using argon.js to create and debug AR web applications for the Argon4 browser. As additional support is added to argon.js for other platforms, we will expand the tutorials as appropriate.

In addition to supporting argon.js content, the Argon4 browser allows multiple AR applications to run at the same time, with their content overlaid. Designers create AR experiences using the argon.js framework and other familiar web technologies, including HTML, CSS3, and popular javascript frameworks, mixing traditional web media content (images, audio, video) with 3D content rendered via WebGL. These tutorials illustrate  basic concepts and functions for coding AR experiences in Argon, using the [three.js](threejs.org) library to manage and render HTML and WebGL content.
